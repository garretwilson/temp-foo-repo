/**
 * This is a test of various approaches to a union of lists, based upon discussions between Garret Wilson and Bruno from Google.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The discussion was based upon a scenario where various people (e.g. in a social network) each have various friends, and it is desired to determine which
 * friends all the people have in common.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Garret brainstormed by suggesting counting all the occurrences of all friends and using only those friends that have an ending count equal to the number of
 * friends. Bruno pointed out that this would have large memory implications.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The ending solution favored by Bruno was one in which a new set of the current union was carried forward each time.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This class presents a third alternative, a hybrid of the two approaches, which maintains low memory overhead yet improves the execution time by over 30%.
 * </p>

	 * Tests three approaches to getting the union of multiple lists.
	 * <p>
	 * The test performs several iterations, generating new test data each time. The test data generation is rather inefficient: the friends generated are
	 * "oversampled" (that is, random friends are generated more times than there are people) in order to make it more likely that there exist friends in common
	 * with all people (as the random number generator will create duplicates). The numbers are therefore not arbitrary to create what is believed to be a
	 * reasonable/typical number of friends in common. A better test data generator would "force" the number of common friends to some predetermined number, but
	 * this would require a more complicated test generation algorithm.
