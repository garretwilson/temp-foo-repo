/* "enum generics not recognized; breaks compiler; works in Eclipse"

I have "public interface MyInterface<T extends Enum<T> & OtherInterface>" as the generic type of an interface, and one of the methods of the interface returns type T, which is obviously an enum. However, a separate static method that takes an enum as an argument will not recognize the returned type T as an enum.

See attached test case.

The attached test case fails to compile both in JDK 6 and JDK 7. It compiles fine in Eclipse 4.2.1.

BugEnum.java:24: error: method getSerializationName in class BugEnum cannot be applied to given types;
              System.out.println(getSerializationName(testMessage.getCommand()));
                                 ^
required: E
found: INT#1
reason: inferred type does not conform to declared bound(s)
  inferred: INT#1
  bound(s): Enum<INT#1>
where E is a type-variable:
  E extends Enum<E> declared in method <E>getSerializationName(E)
where CAP#1 is a fresh type-variable:
  CAP#1 extends INT#1 from capture of ?
where INT#1 is an intersection type:
  INT#1 extends Enum<CAP#1>,Command
