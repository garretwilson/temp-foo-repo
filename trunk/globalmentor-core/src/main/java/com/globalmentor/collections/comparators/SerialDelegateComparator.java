The last comparator in the sequence should unambiguously distinguish non-equal objects.
<p>If this comparator is used in descending order mode, delegate comparators that implement {@link SortOrderComparator} should be used
in ascending mode, as this comparator will sort in reverse order automatically; otherwise, the descending orders will cancel
each other out and each sub-comparison will be performed in ascending order.</p>
<p>Descending order for this comparator does <em>not</em> mean that the delegates will be traversed in reverse order.</p>
@param <T> The type of objects that may be compared by this comparator.
