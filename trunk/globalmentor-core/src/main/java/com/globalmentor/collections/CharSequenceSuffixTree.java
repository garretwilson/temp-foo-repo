/**
 * A suffix tree for a sequence of characters.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This class builds a suffix tree from a sequence of characters in O(N) time following Ukkonen's algorithm. The first version of this algorithm was followed by
 * closely following Mark Nelson's explanation and C++ algorithm presented in <a href="http://marknelson.us/1996/08/01/suffix-trees/">Fast String Searching With
 * Suffix Trees</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Notes:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>This implementation uses exclusive end positions rather than inclusive end positions, which are more intuitive, make calculations easier, and interact
 * nicely with the Java API.</li>
 * <li>The original implementation needlessly tied the edge splitting logic to a particular suffix. While this doesn't affect functionality, it doesn't
 * logically isolate the process of splitting an edge at a particular location, which is completely independent from a suffix. It merely needs to be known at
 * what point along the edge the split should occur. This implementation also splits an edge by creating two new edges rather than merely modifying one.</li>
 * <li>The original article used a "suffix" class that with a node and character indexes. This implementation reverts to the more general "state" terminology
 * used by Ukkonen. Furthermore, the end character index has been changed to exclusive, allowing a state "length" property to be more natural. It also allows
 * the "explicit" state to be more readily apparently---the state in which <code>start==end</code>. Finally, these modifications reduce the state canonization
 * logic to simply "consume edges until the next edge is not small enough to consume or the state is explicit".</li>
 * <li>The original implementation kept a record of the current last character being added. With every iteration the suffix/state had its endpoint incremented,
 * making a separate last-character variable redundant.</li>
 * <li>The algorithm here checks to see when the state start has gone past the end; this signals that the current iteration is finished, and there is no need
 * loop around and check for an edge emanating from the current active node, because the state was explicit in the previous iteration so an edge had to have
 * been created.</li>
 * <li>The traditional algorithm has been modified slightly to construct an explicit suffix tree on the last round without the need of a unique
 * "dummy character" appended to the string. This may result in some edges that are empty, as well as an extra, empty edge emanating from the root node
 * representing the empty string suffix.</li>
 * </ul>
