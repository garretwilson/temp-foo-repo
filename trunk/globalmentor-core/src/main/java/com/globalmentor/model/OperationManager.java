/**
 * A class for managing and executing operations.

 * <p>
 * This is a lightweight manager of task-like objects that are to be executed serially.
 * </p>

 * <p>
 * An operation manager is similar to the Java AWT thread; it allows multiple operations to be queued and executed serially. An operation can be queued by
 * calling {@link #schedule(Operation)}. The operation, if not canceled, will eventually be started using {@link Operation#run()}.
