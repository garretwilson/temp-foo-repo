/**The encapsulation of changes to be performed on a resource, consisting of properties to be removed and/or added.
Alternations are to be performed in the following order:
<ol>
	<li>Any property URI-based removals are performed.</li>
	<li>Any property value removals, for property URIs not removed, are performed.</li>
	<li>Any property value additions are performed.</li>
</ol>
To set a property to the exclusion of all other values, a property addition should be provided and its property URI
included in the set of property URI removals.
<p>If no resource URI is provided, it means that the current URI of the resource should remain unchanged.
Because of these semantics, this interface does not provide a means for indicating a resource should become unnamed.</p>
