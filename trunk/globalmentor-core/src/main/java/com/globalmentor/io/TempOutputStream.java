/**
 * An output stream used for the temporary collection of bytes. The bytes are collected in memory using a {@link ByteArrayOutputStream}. If the collected bytes
 * rise above a configured threshold, bytes are collected instead in a temporary file that is removed when the output stream is closed. No additional buffering
 * is performed, allowing buffered to be controlled at a higher level.
 * 
 * <p>
 * An input stream to the collected bytes can be requested at any time using {@link #getInputStream()}. Retrieving an input stream effectively closes the output
 * stream and any future writes will fail. Retrieving an input stream also calls {@link #dispose()}, regardless of the auto-dispose setting.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Once the stream is closed, if auto-dispose is turned on the underlying output stream is released and the temporary file, if any, is deleted. Thus if it is
 * not known exactly when the stream will be closed, either auto-dispose should be turned off and/or a subclass should be created that overrides
 * {@link #beforeClose()}, at which point {@link #getInputStream()} can be called to retrieve the written bytes.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * It is very important to properly close this output stream when finished using it; otherwise, orphaned temporary files may remain. It is similarly important
 * to close any retrieved input stream for the same reason.
 * </p>
