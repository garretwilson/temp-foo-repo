/**
 * An output stream used for the temporary collection of bytes. The bytes are collected in memory using a {@link ByteArrayOutputStream}. If the collected bytes
 * rise above a configured threshold, bytes are collected instead in a temporary file that is removed when the output stream is closed. No additional buffering
 * is performed, allowing buffered to be controlled at a higher level.
 * 
 * <p>
 * An input stream to the collected bytes can be requested at any time using {@link #getInputStream()}, but if any bytes are written to the output stream after
 * the input stream is retrieved, the input stream is closed and released.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Once the stream is closed, the underlying output stream is released and the temporary file, if any, is deleted. Thus if it is not known exactly when the
 * stream will be closed, a subclass should be created that overrides {@link #beforeClose()}, at which point {@link #getInputStream()} can be called to retrieve
 * the written bytes.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * It is very important to properly close this output stream when finished using it; otherwise, orphaned temporary files may remain.
