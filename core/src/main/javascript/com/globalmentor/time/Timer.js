/**
 * A class implementing a timer.
 * 
 * The timer can count up or down. The timer can be started, stopped, and reset. The timer has the following states:
 * <dl>
 * <dt><dfn>active</dfn></dt>
 * <dd>The timer is running.</dd>
 * <dt><dfn>paused</dfn></dt>
 * <dd>The timer is temporarily not running; when started it continue where it left off.</dd>
 * <dt><dfn>stopped</dfn></dt>
 * <dd>The timer is terminally not running, but it has not reached its target. When started it will start from the
 * beginning, effective to being reset.</dd>
 * <dt><dfn>finished</dfn></dt>
 * <dd>The timer is terminally not running because it reached its target. When started it will start from the
 * beginning, effective to being reset.</dd>
 * </dl>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The above states are logical conditions, which can be stored independent of whether the timer is actually executing
 * in memory. A JavaScript timer is maintained internally to actually make the timer run.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Internally the timer keeps track of its value using one of two properties. If the timer is active, the timer's value
 * is calculated from a <dfn>base time</dfn> (the standard milliseconds since the epoch), which allows the elapsed time
 * to be easily calculated at any time, even if the program is suspended. If the timer is not active, its value is
 * stored as the actual milliseconds elapsed since the base time, allowing the timer to be restarted at exactly the time
 * it left off, regardless of the time that has passed during its inactive state.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Loading and saving the timer across time zones is not supported.
 * </p>
 * 
 * @param targetElapsedTime The relative target time, in milliseconds.
 * @param ascending <code>true</code> if the timer should count up, or <code>false</code> if the timer should count
 *          down.
 * @param updateFrequency The number of milliseconds between updates (default 1000).
 * @property id The optional id of the timer; used when saving/loading values.
 * @property onUpdate The function, if any, that is called each time the timer updates (which is usually but not
 *           necessarily associated with a value change).
 * @property onStateChange The function, if any, that is called when the timer's state changes.
 * 
 * Dependencies: javascript.js
