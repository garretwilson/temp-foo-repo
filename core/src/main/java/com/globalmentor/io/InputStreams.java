	 * Loads the contents of an input stream into an array of bytes. The input stream will be left open after this operation.
	 * @implSpec This implementation creates a series of smaller buffers and, once the end of the stream has been reached, creates a new buffer and copies the
	 *           contents of each buffer into the new buffer. The buffer size starts at {@value #INITIAL_READ_BUFFER_SIZE} and doubles, up to a maximum of
	 *           {@value #MAX_READ_BUFFER_SIZE}, each time a new buffer is created.
	 * @implNote Using multiple small buffers is assumed to be faster (though it temporarily uses more memory) than using {@link ByteArrayOutputStream} because
	 *           that class copies all bytes that have been read each time the buffer needs to be expanded.
	 * @implNote There have been <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/8381338">claims</a> that some JVMs may not be able to allocate arrays of
	 *           {@link Integer#MAX_VALUE}; This method may fail reading slightly less than {@link Integer#MAX_VALUE} bytes if there are JVM-dependent limitations
	 *           on byte array length.
	 * @param inputStream The input stream from which to read.
	 * @return An array of bytes from the input stream.
	 * @throws IOException Thrown if there is an error loading the bytes.
	 * @throws OutOfMemoryError if an array of the required size cannot be allocated, either because not enough memory is available or the JVM cannot otherwise
	 *           create an array with the required number of bytes.
