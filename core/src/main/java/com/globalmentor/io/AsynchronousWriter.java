/**
 * Writer that queues information and writes the information to the underlying writer asynchronously.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Information is written in the order in which character arrays are committed to the underlying queue. Characters within a particular buffer are guaranteed to
 * be written in the order received. This writer uses a producer/consumer paradigm with multiple threads and a blocking queue. This writer is thread-safe. In
 * addition, a copy is made of all data written so that any data structure, such as a character buffer, can be reused after production has occurred.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Because this writer does not synchronize production, the writer is not guaranteed to throw an {@link IOException} if the writer is closed by another thread
 * immediately before a write operation returns. This implies that that information written to the writer at the same time another thread closes this writer has
 * a slight possibility of being discarded with no error. If synchronized production is desired, access to this writer's production methods should be
 * synchronized externally. If access to production methods are synchronized, they should be synchronized on the lock used to construct the writer or, if no
 * custom lock was used to construct the writer, on the writer itself.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The {@link #close()} and {@link #drain()} operations block until finished.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The {@link #flush()} operation does not block until finished.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Whether or not this writer is synchronized, it will block when producing information if the underlying blocking queue has a fixed length and is full, as is
 * the standard contract for {@link BlockingQueue}.
 * </p>
