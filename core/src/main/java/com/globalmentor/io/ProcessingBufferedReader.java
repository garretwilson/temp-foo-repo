/**
 * A reader that buffers data and allows this data to be processed before handing it to the consumer. This class also allows marking and resetting, as well as
 * peeking upcoming buffered characters.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The class maintains an internal buffer, which is of size <var>bufferSize</var>, part of which is used for the undo buffer of size <var>undoBufferSize</var>.
 * The following indexes are maintained in the buffer:
 * </p>
 * <dl>
 * <dt><var>readIndex</var></dt>
 * <dd>The index of the next character to be read.</dd>
 * <dt><var>peekIndex</var></dt>
 * <dd>The index of the next character to be peeked. After each read this is set to equal <var>readIndex</var>.</dd>
 * <dt><var>bufferEndIndex</var></dt>
 * <dd>The index directly after the last character in the buffer.</dd>
 * <dt><var>fetchBufferIndex</var></dt>
 * <dd>The index where a new buffer should be read. The default implementation is for <var>fetchBufferIndex</var> to equal <var>bufferEndIndex</var>, but
 * processing of a stream may determine that rebuffering should occur earlier -- if a "\r\n" is split across buffers, for instance.</dd>
