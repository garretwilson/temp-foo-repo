	 *          to keep track of an initial value when the consumer may never have been invoked. A "count" starts off with zero invocations, and in a parallel
	 *          context the concept of an "index" would not necessarily be accurate, as consumers may be called in an arbitrary order.
	 * @implSpec This implementation delegates to {@link #countingConsumer(AtomicLong, BiConsumer)} with a new counter initially set to zero.
	 * @implNote The returned consumer is thread-safe; each invocation will provide a unique count, although with concurrent invocations the counts will not
	 *           necessarily be in order.
	 * @param <T> The type of input argument.
	 * @param biConsumer The consumer accepting the input argument along with the count.
	 * @return A consumer that keeps track of the count of invocations and passes that to the enclosed consumer.
