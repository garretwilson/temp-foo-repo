/**
 * Lightweight class for measuring elapsing time.
 * @apiNote This is a thin wrapper over calling {@link System#nanoTime()} and performing subtraction to measure elapsed time as needed. It is is meant to
 *          replace boilerplate and reduce the risk of errors through repetition; it is not intended to compete with more full-function classes that allow
 *          starting and stopping counting, or provide new pluggable composite types for mocking time sources (although this class does use a general
 *          {@link Supplier} of time).
 * @implSpec By default this class uses {@link System#nanoTime()} as its time supplier, but any time supplier can be used with any {@link TimeUnit}.
