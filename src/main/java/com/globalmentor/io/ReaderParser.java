/**
 * Parsing methods that work on a {@link Reader}. The reader must support marking.
 * <p>
 * This parser supports several general operations:
 * </p>
 * <dl>
 * <dt><dfn>check</dfn></dt>
 * <dd>Checks the parsed content, throwing an exception if the content does not match that expected. The content is consumed. Implies that an exception will be
 * thrown if the end of the content is reached. Semantically a "check" operation is equivalent to a "confirm" operation that throws an exception if the result
 * is <code>false</code>.</dd>
 * <dt><dfn>confirm</dfn></dt>
 * <dd>Compares the content and returns whether it matches that expected. If the content matches, it is consumed. If the content does not match, it is not
 * consumed. No exception is thrown based upon the match.</dd>
 * <dt><dfn>reach</dfn></dt>
 * <dd>Reads content until some delimiter is encountered. The reached content is not returned. By default no exception is thrown if the end of the content is
 * reached, unless the method indicates that reaching the delimiter is required.</dd>
