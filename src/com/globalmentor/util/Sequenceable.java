<p>This interface differs from {@link Iterator} in the semantics of the
	"get next" functionality. An {@link Iterator} is an independent object
	that returns different next objects after successive calls. A
	{@link Sequenceable} is an object that is part of a sequence, which will
	always return the successive object after <var>this</var> (which will
	seldom change).</p>
@param <E> The type of element in the sequence.
